# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Discussed with Harsha the goals for this challenge, a potential collaboration on a data science project, and why do this challenge. I will start this challenge on January 9th, 2020.

**Thoughts:** Complacency is the kiss of death. I feel I've become complacement in my learning process -- splashing around in shallow waters instead of diving deep. Through this challenge, I seek to attack all the things that most frustrate me and make me feel less than capable. No more copy and paste from stackoverflow (or at least significantly cut back). It will be I who answers stackoverflow questions. 

### Day 1: January 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: If unchecked, plotting will be the death of me. Thus, I chose to get on with it by going through this ggplot2 Tutorial (http://r-statistics.co/Complete-Ggplot2-Tutorial-Part1-With-R-Code.html) and learn about the ins and outs of one of the most useful R plotting packages out there.

**Thoughts** Once I master ggplot, I will only ever communicate in plots.
